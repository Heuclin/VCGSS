Title: Bayesian varying coefficient model with selection using group spike-and-slab prior
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This R package implements the Bayesian varying coefficient model proposed in Heuclin et al. (2020). This model allows, in a single step, the identification of variables involved in the variability of numerical response variable and the estimation of their dynamic effects. Variable selection is achieved using a group spike-and-slab priors with either  P-spline interpolation  or  non-functional techniques to model the dynamic effects.
